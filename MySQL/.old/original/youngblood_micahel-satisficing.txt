Satisficing, a "handy blended word combining satisfy with suffice", is a decision-making strategy that attempts to meet criteria for adequacy, rather than to identify an optimal solution.

To me, it means to give the user what they need, and make it as awesome as it can be. Instead of giving them a lot of cool features, give them the features they needed when they wanted the app and make those work as well as they can.
