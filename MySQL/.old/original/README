Emp-Man: A FSO Multi-Course Project. Built to create and manage information about employees at a call center.

I use the readme file to keep track of what I need to do, inside and outside what is assigned. 


Wimba - May 2 2012 notes: 

- json.js needs 20 people, I can use the contact list that I made the other day for phone switch changes

- what is the bronze gold file structure that is required? 

- replace $(x) with something like ge(x), the dollar will break JQuery

- appealing visual

- logo (branding) 

- make a better short description

- call to action should be:

- need search bar

- feature, cta, logo, and search should be above the fold. should also have a little bit of the browsing

- remember to justify any decisions

- easter eggs? 42

- mini assignments due monday

- each class will have a folder and each week will have a branch in GIT

- reflection videos maybe 3-5 minutes now

- provide justification for all answers or decisions or choices

- discussion videos are due friday night, by saturday night i need to have 2 responses to other classmates, address the person to whom you are responding too


mini assignment

My name is Michael Youngblood. I don't mind shortened names. In fact, my friends and co-workers just call me YB. You may call me whatever comes to mind when you need to address me. 

My iChat handle is aliendev@fullsail.edu. The best time of day I can be available is between 11:00am and 12:00pm (my lunch period) PST. I live south of Seattle, WA.
