hello hello, my name is michael youngblood. this is my discussion video for 1205 MiU week 4. 


Share how you've improved your application's overall aesthetic, and how it supports a better users experience.

I imporved my apps overal aesthetic by adding a plaid deep bg. The plaid pattern is very slight but is visiual enough to have the vertical lines help your eyes follow the page down. 



How has your improved aesthetic changed the usability of your app, to better support your users goals, based on the apps intent?

I think the improvments we did during week four help the user stay engaged into the app. the background helps with the flow, the streamlined logo help the user stay comfortable knowing he/she is on the same site he started out to be and the few hues many values keeps the interface from being too busy.
